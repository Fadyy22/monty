# Monty Bytecode Interpreter

The Monty Byte Code Interpreter is a program designed to execute Monty byte code files. Monty is a simple, stack-based programming language.

<h2>The Monty language</h2>

Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.


## Usage

To use the Monty Byte Code Interpreter, follow these instructions:

```bash
$ monty file
Where file is the path to the file containing Monty byte code.
